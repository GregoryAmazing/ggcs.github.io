            <span class="cardcontent">People usually associate Mexico with drug cartels and mafia, however that is just a stereotype. Yes, those things exist, but mainly the cities are completely safe and the people are quite welcoming Approximately 40 million people visit Mexico every year and violence against tourists is especially rare. So don't let the media scare you away from this wonderful country.</span>

            <span class="cardtitle">2. Means of transportation</span> <br>
            <span class="cardcontent">There are a few types of buses in Mexico - The Chicken Bus, the Modern Coach, and the City Bus. The Chicken Bus is the cheapest, but not the most comfortable option, costing less than a dollar per hour! The Modern Coach is surprisingly very comfortable, it more often than not has, reclining seats and snack offerings. But it will cost you 1-3$ per hour.</span>

            <span class="cardtitle">3. Packing the essentials</span> <br>
            <span class="cardcontent">First things first, you need to pack is bug spray and sunscreen. When you get to Mexico, you will find that these items are overpriced (up to 10 bucks), so it's better to pack beforehand. Also, while packing all of your electronic device charges, you must get a universal adapter, in order to avoid getting stuck without all of your gadgets.</span>
