            <span class="cardcontent">The currency in Mexico is the Mexican peso, sometimes referred to as the "Nuevo Peso,". You can change money in banks, but it is often more convenient to change currency in a casa de cambio (exchange bureau). These businesses are open longer hours than banks, usually do not have long line-ups as banks often do, and they offer comparable exchange rates (though banks may offer a slightly better rate). Check around to see where you will receive the best exchange rate (the exchange rate is usually posted prominently outside the bank or casa de cambio).

            <img src="9p.png" id="thumbimg" style="object-position: 0 40%;">
            <span class="cardcontent">Mexico has one of the most profound cultures in the world. So to visit Mexico and not go sightseeing is truly a crime. If you want to visit some historically crucial places, but don't know where to start, you might want to visit "Chichen Itza" first. It is a ruined ancient Maya city occupying an area of 4 square miles (10 square km) in south-central Yucatán state, Mexico. The most recognizable structure here is the Temple of Kukulkan, also known as El Castillo. This glorious step pyramid demonstrates the accuracy and importance of Maya astronomy. The temple has 365 steps—one for each day of the year. <br>
            Some other honorable mentions are: Teotihuacan, Oaxaca, Copper Canyon, and Puebla.

            <img src="10p.png" id="thumbimg" style="object-position: 0 50%;">
            <span class="cardcontent">There are fake taxi cabs with drivers that can take advantage of you, so to avoid being taken for a ride, it's best to hire an authorized taxi from an official rank (sitio) or call for one. <br>
            These fake taxis can also be the starting point of Secuestro exprés (express kidnapping). If you are spending time in one place and find a good authorized taxi driver, grab their number; that way if you need to head out for the night or just get around, you can be sure you are getting someone reliable.
