            <span class="cardcontent">The currency in Mexico is the Mexican peso, sometimes referred to as the "Nuevo Peso,". You can change money in banks, but it is often more convenient to change currency in a casa de cambio (exchange bureau). These businesses are open longer hours than banks, usually do not have long line-ups as banks often do, and they offer comparable exchange rates (though banks may offer a slightly better rate). Check around to see where you will receive the best exchange rate (the exchange rate is usually posted prominently outside the bank or casa de cambio.
